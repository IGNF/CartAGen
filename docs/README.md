Description
-------------

CartAGen is a Java research platform dedicated to map generalization and [built upon many years of research at IGN France][6]. CartAGen can be seen as a plugin for [GeOxygene][2] Java platform or as a standalone platform.
It contains implementations of many generalization algorithms of the literature, but most of all, it contains implementations of [several map generalization processes][7] that automatically orchestrate these algorithms, including complete or partial implementations of the multi-agents based AGENT, CartACom, GAEL, and CollaGen models.
