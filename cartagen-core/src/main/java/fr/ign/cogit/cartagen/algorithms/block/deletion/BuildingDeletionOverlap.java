/**
 * Algorithm to delete the buildings of a block using the overlapping rate of
 * the buildings: at each iteration, the building with the highest overlapping
 * rate is deleted if this rate is higher than a threshold. The overlapping rate
 * is the area of the building divided by the sum of the areas of intersections
 * with the overlapping buildings. If two buildings have the same overlapping
 * rate, the smallest one is ranked first.
